App hosted on heroku here (will take time to start): https://thawing-atoll-33381.herokuapp.com/

Code for React app can be found in directory 'note-app'

### Starting the application locally

Make sure PostgreSQL service is running (my default configuration is on port 5433) before running the application.

Launch the local version with
```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

If foreman is not installed, you can install it with
```
gem install foreman
```
